 Weather app + API calls (https://openweathermap.org/api)

In this app I use Api calls to get weather data and present it to user interface

For the moment I work to update the App in order to get User location by default
In case if user didn`t allowed permision to app to get location, it could be obtained by clicking on GeoLocationButton
